Noise Solution is a social purpose organisation which engages youth at risk through informal music mentoring, using an evidence based approach to create the conditions which are likely to positively impact on wellbeing and intrinsic motivation. This presentation shows how their music mentoring sessions effectively improves the wellbeing of the participants, measured using the SWEMWBS questionnaire.

## Basic Information

### Participants

```{r}
library(dplyr)
participants <- n_distinct(df$UIN) #the number of distinct participants
valueBox(participants, icon = "fa-solid fa-user-group", color = "#BEFF00")
```

### Sessions

```{r}
sessions <- nrow(df) #the number of sessions
valueBox(sessions, icon = "fa-regular fa-file", color = "#BEFF00")
```

### **Proportions of Sessions with an increase in the wellbeing score (286 in total)** {.third-box}

```{r}
successful_sessions <- df %>%
  mutate(delta = `SWEMWBS End Score` - `SWEMWBS Start Score`, #we quantify the difference between the initial and final score for each session
         class = case_when(delta > 0 ~ "positive",
                           delta == 0 ~ "none",
                           delta < 0 ~ "negative")) %>% #we assign each session to a class based on the their outcome
  count(class) %>% #we count how many sessions each class contains
  mutate(perc = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>% #we calculate each class percentage of sessions over the total number of them
  slice(3) %>%  pull() #we extract the value of the successful sessions
gauge(successful_sessions, min = 0, max = 100, symbol = '%', gaugeSectors(success = c(60, 100), warning = c(40, 59), danger = c(0, 39)))
```

The graph on the right shows these sessions, and, if we compare the start scores to the end ones, we notice a significant shift from the "low" wellbeing band (determined, based on national averages, to be between 7 and 21.54) to the "high" wellbeing one (between 23.22 and 26.02).

## Interactive Graph

```{r, fig.width = 7}
library(ggplot2)
pg <- df %>%
  group_by(UIN) %>%
  mutate(n = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(UIN2 = paste0(UIN, "-", n), #we create a new id, to distinguish between participants that attended several sessions
         `First Score` = `SWEMWBS Start Score`, 
         `Last Score` = `SWEMWBS End Score`) %>% #we change these variable names for plotting purposes (to use an alphabetical ordering)
  mutate(delta = `Last Score` -`First Score`) %>% #we quantify the difference in scores for each session
  filter(delta > 0) %>% #we concentrate on the sessions that had a positive outcome
  tidyr:::pivot_longer(cols = c(`First Score`, `Last Score`), names_to = "variable", values_to = "values") %>% #data transformation to facilitate plotting
  ggplot(aes(values, UIN2)) +
  geom_point(aes(frame = variable, ids = UIN2), color = "#01070A") + #we plot each session as a point on a scale that measures the SWEMWBS score
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(7, 21.55, 23.22), color = "gray") + #we add the thresholds for the low, moderate and high wellbeing bands
