# VFSG-for-Noise-Solution

The file of interest for the organization is the html one, which is an interactive dashboard. 
I hope that there will be no problems in correctly visualizing it on devices different than my own (I use Chrome on a Windows machine).
The Rmd file is for whoever is interested in replicating it or to doublecheck for any mistakes.
